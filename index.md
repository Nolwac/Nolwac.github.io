The best way to learn something is to live that thing. If you want to learn how to program, then you have to be a programmer, to learn faster, what this means is that you have to try solving problems with programs, build tools with the little you learn each day. If you want to learn to be a good mathematician then you have to learn to solve a lot of maths problems, be the mathematician. If you want to learn journalism, the best way is to become a journalist go to the field and practice that which you want to learn. Experience teaches better than any other approach. [So start learning today!][Youtube] with the tools and materials that I have provided for you to learn.
