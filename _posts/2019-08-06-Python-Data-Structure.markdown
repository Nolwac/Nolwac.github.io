`Data Structure` is simply the format in which data is presented. In Python data can be represented in the following forms:
<ul>
  <li>LIST</li>
  <li>TUPLE</li>
  <li>DICTIONARY</li>
  <li>ARRAY</li>
  <li>SET</li>
  <li>CSV</li>
  <li>BINARY</li>
</ul>
And many more other formats that could be used in presenting our data. It is very important to know that the way we represented our data affects the our programming algorithm. So it is very important to understand the different formats or structures in presenting data before we start programming our software, So in this part of the tutorial what we shall be looking at is the different structures or formats in which our data could come in Python.
