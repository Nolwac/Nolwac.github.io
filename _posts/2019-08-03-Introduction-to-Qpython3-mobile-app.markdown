Not having a computer can not stop us from learning Python, we can learn with our mobile device, I learnt my first Programming language C++, using the android app `C4Droid`. I had not computer so I had to find a way to use what I had available, so I came across C4Droid, and that was what I used.

Qpython3 provides a very robust interface for developing with Python on our mobile phone. It is very good as it has:

<ul>
  <li>built-in console for Python and pip</li>
  <li>Editor supporting syntax highlighting for Python and tools like HTML</li>
  <li>debugging tools</li>
  <li>Search tools</li>
</ul>
And many other interesting features. Go to your playstore on android and search for Qpython3 to download the app.
